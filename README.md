Auth System Demo
Overview:
The Auth System Demo is a React-based web application that showcases an authentication flow using the Context API and React Router. This app allows users to input their details (such as username) through a login form and then displays the user's name dynamically on the navigation bar of the dashboard page.

This project demonstrates the practical use of React's Context API for state management and React Router for page navigation, providing a seamless user experience across different components.

Features:-
User Authentication: A simple login form where users can enter their name and login to access a dashboard.
State Management: Using React's Context API to globally manage and share user details (like the username) between components.
Dynamic UI: The username entered during login is displayed on the navigation bar of the dashboard, showcasing real-time updates across components.
Routing: Navigating between different pages (Login and Dashboard) using React Router.
Clean and Readable Design: The app has been designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring a smooth user interface and seamless interaction.
